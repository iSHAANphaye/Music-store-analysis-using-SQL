# Music-store-analysis-using-SQL

I made this project to analyze a database, in this case called "Music Store DB", using SQL techniques ranging from levels easy to hard. I explored the database and found key points of interest such as: 
* Finding out the best genre of music.
* The total revenue made by a particular band, further sorting this data to find the top 10 best bands in terms of money made.
* Finding out the most popular genre of music by country, among others.

### Database and Tools
* PostgreSQL
* PgAdmin4

### Schema: Music DB
